This algorithm can be mainly used for cleaning data. It helps in predicting the gender of a given image from the face in the image. If the face is not found, the image gets deleted. We can customize the algorithm according to our needs. 

## General Script

```python

from deepface import DeepFace # Pretrained model which is present in DeepFace library.
from tqdm import tqdm # Used to create a bar that represents process progress.
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import time
import os
start = time.time()
# plt.imshow(img[:,:,::-1])
# plt.show() # To display the image if required.

dire = r"Location of folder in which all the files are present"
for img in tqdm(os.listdir(dire)):
    path = dire+'/'+img
    try:
        # print(path)
        img = cv2.imread(path)
        result = DeepFace.analyze(img, actions= ['gender'])
        # print("Gender: ", result['gender']) 
        if result['gender'] # We can make changes here for custom use.
            os.remove(path)
    except ValueError:
        os.remove(path)
print("All is done.") # To understand that all the process is finished.
time.sleep(1)
end = time.time()
print(f"Runtime of the program is {end-start}") # To print out the final execution time.

```
## Use Cases:-

## 1. To keep only the images that contain Human face and remove noisy images.

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Gender_based_cleaning_algorithm/blob/6ab531cc304eaa80d52a02556cf2a75abd2b9845/Data/Unprocessed%20data.png" width="900"/></div>
The folder contains a combination of several images taken from the internet. The files are images of different genders and some corrupted ones. We can use our script to get rid of these noisy images. 


### Noise in Face data

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Gender_based_cleaning_algorithm/blob/e44635725851404a1143618f275c41d1329ddb59/Data/Noise%20in%20face%20data.png" width="400" height="440"></p>

The noisy images shown here are not just random images. These are actually images which contain the features of a face in some way. These are the output of face cropped out from an MTCNN face detector model.

### Implementation

We only need to make changes to one line of the general script as follows:-
```python
if result['gender'] != "Man" and result['gender'] != "Woman": #change the General script with this line of code.
    os.remove(path)

```
After running the script we will obtain the following results as shown below.

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Gender_based_cleaning_algorithm/blob/6ab531cc304eaa80d52a02556cf2a75abd2b9845/Data/Cleaned_data_all_gender.png" width="900"/></div>

All images except the ones with human faces are removed

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/nelson123-lab/Gender_based_cleaning_algorithm/blob/6ab531cc304eaa80d52a02556cf2a75abd2b9845/Data/Time_taken%20and_count.png" width="900"/></div>

Progress bar is shown for understanding the cleaning status. 
Total execution time will be printed out at the end along with the text "All is done".

## 2. To count the no of images with human faces.

The same directory above is used here. To find out the count of images with human faces we need to add a variable count and make some necessary changes.

```python
from deepface import DeepFace
from tqdm import tqdm
import cv2
import os

dire = r"Location of folder in which all the files are present"
count = 0 #Initiated count
for img in tqdm(os.listdir(dire)):
    path = dire+'/'+img
    try:
        img = cv2.imread(path)
        result = DeepFace.analyze(img, actions= ['gender'])
        if result['gender'] == "Man" or result['gender'] == "Woman":
            count += 1 # Count value is incremented when a face is found.
    except ValueError:
        pass
print("No of human faces =",count)
```
Output is given as 

```python
No of human faces = 9
```

## 3. To keep only the images with face of Man.

### Implementation

We only need to make changes to one line of the general script as follows:-
```python
if result['gender'] != "Man" #change the General script with this line of code.
    os.remove(path)
```

After running the script we will obtain the folder consisting of only images of man and rest of them removed.

## 4. To keep only the images with face of Woman.

### Implementation

We only need to make changes to one line of the general script as follows:-
```python
if result['gender'] != "Woman" #change the General script with this line of code.
    os.remove(path)

```
After running the script we will obtain the folder consisting of only images of woman and rest of them removed.

# Dependency Installation

The easiest way to install the required libraries is to download it from [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/). It's going to install the libraries itself and its prerequisites as well. 

```python
pip install deepface
```
-Deepface is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis (age, gender, emotion and race) framework for python. It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping state-of-the-art models: VGG-Face, Google FaceNet, OpenFace, Facebook DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace and Dlib. The library is mainly powered by TensorFlow and Keras.
Experiments show that human beings have 97.53% accuracy on facial recognition tasks whereas those models already reached and passed that accuracy level.

```python
pip install tqdm
```
-tqdm instantly make your loops show a smart progress meter - just wrap any iterable with tqdm(iterable), and youâ€™re done!

```python
pip install opencv-python
```
-OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library: http://opencv.org) is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.

```python
pip install matplotlib
```
-Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

-The time and OS modules are part of Python's standard library. So no need to download it.

Then you will be able to import the libraries and use its functionalities.
