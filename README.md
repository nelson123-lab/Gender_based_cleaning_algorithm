# Gender_based_cleaning_algorithm

This algorithm can be mainly used for cleaning data. It helps in predicting the gender of a given image. If no face is found it will be shown as no face data availabe. We are using the above features to clean the data so that we could obtain
1. Only the images that contain Human face.
2. Only the images with Faces of Males.
3. Only the images with faces of Females.
